A Firefox (>= 26) add on: Quick context menu for saving/opening full
size images from Flickr search results, photostreams, personal feeds
and invidual image views, even when "spaceballed".

Add-on provides a context menu, only available on Flickr and on top of
a full size image even when the original image author has "disabled" image
downloads ie. has "spaceballed" it. The add-on allows you to get a direct
link to the image into your clipboard or a shortened direct link to the
image into your clipboard, save the image to local filesystem or open
just the image (leaving all heavy Flickr junk behind) on a new tab.

In my humble opinion you really should not rely so much on Flickr js-gizmos
to keep your images safe. If you don't want them to spread, why upload them
into the public Internet in the first place?
