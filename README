A Firefox (>= 29) add on: Save image files from Flickr even when "spaceballed".

Add-on provides a context menu, only available on Flickr and on top of
a full size image when the original image author has "disabled" image
downloads ie. has "spaceballed" it. The add-on allows you to get a
direct link to the image into your clipboard or a shortened direct link to
the image into your clipboard, save the image to local filesystem or
open just the image (leaving all heavy Flickr junk behind) on a new tab.
